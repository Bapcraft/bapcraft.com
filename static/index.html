			<h3>Our Unknown Future</h3>
			<em>Written 2017-10-14 @ 21:03</em>
			<p>
				So right now we're in a bit of a disappointing situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last fall (2016) I went off to college.  I figured I'd have
				enough time to keep working on Bapcraft and I was partially
				correct.  But it wasn't nearly enough.  I spent probably more
				time than I should have trying to get Neocore to a usable state
				so that we would have a solid foundation to build Bapcraft 3 on.
				Unfortunately this didn't pan out very well, and I realized that
				it would be best to let our plans for our servers expire and
				move to a DigitalOcean droplet.  The last servers we had before
				the current state were Epsilon (BungeeCord, DB, lobby, etc.),
				Zeta (survival, creative, etc.), and Cthulhu (the old website
				server, retroactively named).  In interest of full-transparency
				I'm also mentioning that Rival and I had briefly tried to run
				our forum on a server named Iota, using Discourse as our forum
				software instead of XenForo.  This still turned out to be more
				work than it was worth, as email is way more difficult to set up
				than it should be.  Currently we are running our single game
				server on a server hosted in New York named Theta.  It's
				basically an Anarchy server but we still have a handful of
				active users, which is nice.  The VPS itself is some really poor
				(virtual) hardware.  It has 1 GB of RAM, a single vCPU, and just
				a 20 GB SSD, of which I've dedicated 1 GB of swap space to.  So
				we really can't have a big world or anything heavy running on
				it.  This website is running off a server named Troy that I use
				for my own website, <a href="http://tr3y.io/">tr3y.io</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				So this is what Bapcraft is going to be for the near future.  I
				don't see myself able to run anything serious by myself as I
				simply don't have enough time to.  And all of the other staff
				members that I've grown to trust either don't have the skills
				necessary to manage Linux machines securely or don't have the
				time to do so.  They have their own lives and I don't want to
				force them to do something they don't want to.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to make Bapcraft into something like what it was in 2014
				and early 2015 with hundreds of active players making enough
				money to sustain itself.  But right now it isn't, and it's
				costing me ~$20/mo to keep it running, but I don't mind that as
				keeping this comminuty alive, even if it's just a memory of its
				former self, is more important to me than an hour and a half of
				work per month.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ultimately, Bapcraft will live on.  Maybe in a few years I'll
				finish Neocore and put together a few tools that will make
				managing Bapcraft a breeze.  But this is what we'll have to live
				with for now.  Love you all!
